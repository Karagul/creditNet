- Supports both classic credit portfolio analysis and peer2peer models
- Flexible multi-period framework with customizable temporal granularity (e.g. monthly / quarterly / annual)
- Multiple analytic approaches and support for both scenario based stress testing and simulation
- Specify detailed liability structures of lenders and/or securitisation vehicles
